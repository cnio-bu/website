## Development of a common, interoperable and integrated system for the collection and analysis of clinical and molecular data

IMPaCT's mission is to establish the pillars to facilitate the effective deployment of Precision Medicine in the National Health System, ensuring scientific-technical quality, equity and efficiency in the use of available scientific resources to respond to the needs of citizens. IMPaCT is divided into three strategic axes: IMPaCT-Cohorte, IMPaCT-Data and IMPaCT-Gen√≥mica. Our group participates in the second of the axes, IMPaCT-Data, which is responsible for supporting the development of a common, interoperable and integrated system for the collection and analysis of clinical and molecular data, contributing the knowledge and resources available in the Spanish Science and Technology System. The ultimate goal is to provide researchers with a population perspective based on individual data.

## Dissecting cellular heterogeneity for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases

Study of the cellular heterogeneity underlying thyroid diseases: from cancer to autoimmune disorders. As the origin of thyroid diseases goes beyond mere thyroid cells, analysing the surrounding microenvironment is crucial for effective diagnosis and response to treatment. The use of computational approaches integrating multi-omics data will allow us to investigate biomarkers of response to treatment and resistance, and also to provide new rationale for alternative personalized treatments.

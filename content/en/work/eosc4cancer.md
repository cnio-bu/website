  brief: "In order to make cancer data accessible, it is necessary to integrate advanced research data beyond national borders in order to make progress. With this idea in mind, EOSC4Cancer brings together a consortium of 29 organizations from 13 countries, including cancer research centers, research infrastructures, cutting-edge research groups, hospitals, and supercomputing centers.
  The well-preserved datasets from EOSC4Cancer will be an essential contribution to reproducible and robust analytical and computational methods, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, laying the foundations for data trajectories and workflows for future European Cancer Mission projects."

## Aligning EOSC4Cancer results with the needs of the research community

EOSC4Cancer is a Europe-wide project that aims to make various types of cancer data accessible: genomic, imaging, medical, clinical, environmental and socio-economic. To this end it uses and enhances federated and interoperable systems to securely identify, share, process and reuse FAIR data across borders and deliver it through community-driven analysis environments.
The project is divided into seven workpackages of which our group leads WP6. It aims to ensure that the results of the project are aligned with the needs of the cancer research community and can be translated into better diagnostics and treatments, as well as having the confidence of patients and research organizations. The developed solutions will be aligned with emerging European structures such as EOSC and the European Health Data Space.

## Aligning EOSC4Cancer results with the needs of the research community

EOSC4Cancer is a Europe-wide project that aims to make various types of cancer data accessible: genomic, imaging, medical, clinical, environmental and socio-economic. To this end it uses and enhances federated and interoperable systems to securely identify, share, process and reuse FAIR data across borders and deliver it through community-driven analysis environments.
The project is divided into seven workpackages of which our group leads WP6. It aims to ensure that the results of the project are aligned with the needs of the cancer research community and can be translated into better diagnostics and treatments, as well as having the confidence of patients and research organizations. The developed solutions will be aligned with emerging European structures such as EOSC and the European Health Data Space.

  brief: "The Spanish National Network of Brain Metastasis (RENACER) is a collaborative effort encompassing nearly 20 research institutions and health care institutions. The joint work of all of them has the objective of identifying, gathering, biobanking, and validating new candidates, drugs, and biomarkers for human brain metastasis."

## Personalized cancer treatments through RENACER

Approximately 10 to 30% of cancer patients experience the development of brain metastases, particularly originating from breast, lung, and skin tumors. In cancer research, two main challenges involve unraveling the reasons certain tumor cells successfully overcome the strong defensive mechanisms of the brain against metastasis and devising therapeutic strategies to impede this fact.

Our laboratory is actively involved in RENACER network leveraging the methodologies developed in our lab for in silico prediction of drug sensitivity using genomics data from patients with brain metastasis. This allows us to propose personalized treatments tailored to the unique characteristics of each tumor patient, enabling the assessment of therapeutic efficacy in treating brain metastases on an individualized basis.

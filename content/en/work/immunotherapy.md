## Optimising the immune response against cancer

Our lab is interested in understanding ways to optimise the immune response to fight cancer while avoiding runaway immune responses that would damage normal tissues. To do so, we have developed DREIMT, a tool and database for hypothesis generation and prioritization of drugs capable of modulating immune cell activity from transcriptomics data.
